			<h2>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</h2>
			<p>MACD is one of the most popular technical indicators among traders and can be effective in helping assess the direction to trade, and the time to enter or exit trades when applied to trending securities. It packs a lot of information into a simple format that’s relatively easy to understand.</p>

			<p>The MACD is usually plotted on a sub-graph below price and has three components: The MACD line, the signal line and the histogram. The MACD line plots the difference between the 12-period and 26-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) by subtracting one from the other. Moving averages smooth ‘noise’ from price volatility and make the trend more readily identifiable. Exponential moving averages differ from simple moving averages by placing more weight on recent prices within the lookback period rather than assigning equal weight to each price in the lookback window. Due to the emphasis on more recent data, some traders feel that exponential moving averages are more significant. The MACD Signal Line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line and produces a triple smoothing of the price data. The horizontal Histogram oscillates around a 0 center line and graphically reflects the distance between the MACD line and the Signal Line.</p>

			<p>Calculation (Default Settings):<br>
			MACD Line: 12-period EMA – 26-period EMA<br>
			MACD Signal Line: 9-period EMA of the MACD<br>
			MACD Histogram: MACD Line – Signal Line</p>

			<p>Trading Signals:<br>
			There are three significant signals that analysts look for when using the MACD indicator.<br>
			1. Crossovers of the MACD Line and Signal Line.<br>
			2. Crossovers of the MACD Line and the Histogram’s zero center line).<br>
			3. Divergences between price action and the MACD Line or Histogram.</p>

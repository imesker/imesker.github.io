				<p>Whether it's a gift for someone special or a splashy item for yourself, Snygg always has something unique.</p>

				<p>All items are created from repurposed, vintage, or remnant fabrics. It may have been a fantastic flannel <br> or your grandmother's curtain in a previous life, but now it's been re-imagined for a new use.</p>
